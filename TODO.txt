# IDEA: can we somehow smooth the tempo over time
# Ideally, we would like a very regular beat
# Could account for the average space between the last several beats somehow?
# We probably just want to use aubio to estimate the tempo!
# It doesn't super matter if we're not exactly on the beat, it matters more that we're consistently spaced

# IDEA: should we have rgbw state, strobe in a base DMXFixture class?
# Most fixtures are going to support this?
# Except some are RGB, some RGBW?
# Maybe wait to refactor until we play with the current setup a bit
# May want to use numpy to interpolate between configs

IDEA: we can have preprogrammed coordinates for the moving heads
- Have them flash or change color to the beat, change target position to the beat
- Sometimes can mirror the yaw rotation, but keep the pitch the same

TODO: establish good/safe positions for moving heads
- start with specifically the positions we don't want

TODO: bpm estimation, may be a useful quantity
TODO: loudness estimation
norm = np.linalg.norm(indata)*10
- we also need to keep some kind of max, or simply a slower running average
- loudness_fast_avg, loudness_slow_avg

TODO: would like to store color as tuple on fixtures
- then we can directly store the rgbw value

TODO: need an animation thread
- thread needs to be able to receive beat events
- can start by prototyping this in test.py

TODO: convert colors to FP values in [0, 1]
TODO: function to map [0, 1] value into range, map_to()
- have fixtures use FP values for everything





[DONE] TODO: max DMX update rate is 40Hz
- add in comment, aim for 35Hz
- measure time between updates, should be 25ms
