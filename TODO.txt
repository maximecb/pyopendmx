# IDEA: can we somehow smooth the tempo over time
# Ideally, we would like a very regular beat
# Could account for the average space between the last several beats somehow?
# We probably just want to use aubio to estimate the tempo!
# It doesn't super matter if we're not exactly on the beat, it matters more that we're consistently spaced

# IDEA: should we have rgbw state, strobe in a base DMXFixture class?
# Most fixtures are going to support this?
# Except some are RGB, some RGBW?
# Maybe wait to refactor until we play with the current setup a bit
# May want to use numpy to interpolate between configs

IDEA: we can have preprogrammed coordinates for the moving heads
- Have them flash or change color to the beat, change target position to the beat
- Sometimes can mirror the yaw rotation, but keep the pitch the same

IDEA: mode with only red, orange and white
IDEA: if we have 4x/5x, can make patterns, move left and right, etc.

TODO: establish good/safe positions for moving heads
- start with specifically the positions we don't want

TODO: bpm estimation, may be a useful quantity

TODO: would like to store color as tuple on fixtures
- then we can directly store the rgbw value
- also good for numpy interpolation

TODO: trigger some events every 2 or 4 beats

IDEA: it will be easy to have multiple animation classes
- you could have one for a more chill mode that's not music-reactive

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have multiple quantities we want to track
- Loudness, with multiple windows (instant, short, long)
- Beat number
- Maybe we can have an animation class with a start_thread method
- Would the fixtures just be global?
- Maybe we can init with the dmx thread

TODO: make colors be assignable as numpy arrays, easily assignable
TODO: random_rgb and random_rgbw
- return numpy arrays

TODO: flash intensity with loudness ***
- compute max value over full time horizon
- this would also solve the issue of flashing when the music stops
- test when music starting








[DONE] TODO: loudness estimation
norm = np.linalg.norm(indata)*10
- we also need to keep some kind of max, or simply a slower running average
- loudness_fast_avg, loudness_slow_avg
- use numpy.std(v)

[DONE] TODO: create a shortcut method for setting dmx val
dmx[self.chan_no + 0] = map_float_to(self.pan, 0, 255)
- dmx.set_float(start_chan, chan_no, val, min=0, max=255)

[DONE] TODO: create a class for the Docooler RGBW moving head

[DONE] TODO: convert colors to FP values in [0, 1]

[DONE] TODO: function to map [0, 1] value into range, map_to()
- have fixtures use FP values for everything

[DONE] TODO: max DMX update rate is 40Hz
- add in comment, aim for 35Hz
- measure time between updates, should be 25ms

[DONE] TODO: DMXUniverse.start_dmx_thread()

[DONE] TODO: DMXUniverse.add_fixture()
